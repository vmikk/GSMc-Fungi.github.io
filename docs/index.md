## About

Fungi are an incredibly diverse group of organisms that play a crucial role in providing a wide range of ecosystem services. Despite their importance, fungi have received far less attention compared to animals and plants. As a result, we have limited knowledge about the distribution patterns and conservation needs of fungi. 
**The Global Soil Mycobiome Consortium (GSMc)**, led by researchers in the [Mycology and Microbiology Center (MMC), University of Tartu](https://mmc.ut.ee/home-1) was initiated in 2015 to fill this gap in our understanding. Building on the success of [a previous global soil fungal survey](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1256688), the GSMc has significantly expanded the geographical and habitat coverage of soil fungi.
The current dataset includes 3200 composite samples (comprising a total of 127 263 sub-samples) collected from sites located across 108 different countries. As a result, this dataset is the largest and most comprehensive collection of soil fungal distribution data obtained following standardized procedures. Our map can be found  [HERE.](sampling_map.md)
The GSMc dataset is readily available to the public over the [PLutoF repository](https://plutof.ut.ee), allowing researches from around the world to access this invaluable resource.
An additional mission of the GSMc is to reward contributing researchers with scientific currency – co-authorships.

The dataset provided by the Global Soil Mycobiome consortium (GSMc) represents a significant advancement over previous public datasets and databases in several important ways: 

(1)	The geographical breadth and number of individual samples (> 125,000) are by far the greatest to date;

(2)	The molecular barcode covers both the entire ITS region and the V9 variable region of the 18S rRNA gene. This combination provides a much greater taxonomic resolution than the ITS1 and ITS2 subregions alone;

(3)	All samples have been collected and processed following the same protocol;

(4)	Molecular analyses such as PCR and library preparation for high-throughput sequencing have been performed in a single laboratory (Mycology and Microbiology Center, University of Tartu);

(5)	To ensure accuracy, the data has been carefully quality-filtered by checking for potential chimeras and contaminants manually for each sequencing run;

(6)	The dataset is equipped with up-to-date taxonomic and functional annotations and metadata, allowing users to reinterpret and analyze the data in new ways; 

(7)	The dataset is freely available to all researchers in a ready-to-use format to encourage incorporation of soil fungi into macroecological analyses and boost understanding of the diversity and distribution of fungi. 

A new release including a short data paper is planned for the year 2024. The progress and early access can be followed via [X, @tedersoo](https://twitter.com/tedersoo?s=20). 


## Funding

Funding of the fieldwork and shipping comes from the GSMc partners. Molecular work is performed by students in the MMC lab and is funded by the following grants: Estonian Science Foundation (grants PRG632, rein), MOBERC, EEA and Norway grants, Novo Nordisk Foundation and King Saud University (DSFP-2021-2023).
