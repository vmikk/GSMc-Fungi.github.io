Despite their importance, fungi have received far less attention compared to animals and plants. As a result, we have limited knowledge about the distribution patterns and conservation needs of fungi.  The Global Soil Mycobiome Consortium (GSMc), led by researchers in the Mycology and Microbiology Center (MMC), University of Tartu was initiated in 2015 to fill this gap in our understanding. Building on the success of a previous global soil fungal survey, the GSMc has significantly expanded the geographical and habitat coverage of soil fungi. The current dataset includes 3200 composite samples (comprising a total of 127 263 sub-samples) collected from sites located across 108 different countries. As a result, this dataset is the largest and most comprehensive collection of soil fungal distribution data obtained following standardized procedures. Our map can be found  HERE. The GSMc dataset is readily available to the public over the PlutoF repository, allowing researches from around the world to access this invaluable resource. An additional mission of the GSMc is to reward contributing researchers with scientific currency \u2013 co-authorships.</p> <p>The dataset provided by the Global Soil Mycobiome consortium (GSMc) represents a significant advancement over previous public datasets and databases in several important ways: </p> <p>(1) The geographical breadth and number of individual samples (&gt; 125,000) are by far the greatest to date;</p> <p>(2) The molecular barcode covers both the entire ITS region and the V9 variable region of the 18S rRNA gene. This combination provides a much greater taxonomic resolution than the ITS1 and ITS2 subregions alone;</p> <p>(3) All samples have been collected and processed following the same protocol;</p> <p>(4) Molecular analyses such as PCR and library preparation for high-throughput sequencing have been performed in a single laboratory (Mycology and Microbiology Center, University of Tartu);</p> <p>(5) To ensure accuracy, the data has been carefully quality-filtered by checking for potential chimeras and contaminants manually for each sequencing run;</p> <p>(6) The dataset is equipped with up-to-date taxonomic and functional annotations and metadata, allowing users to reinterpret and analyze the data in new ways; </p> <p>(7) The dataset is freely available to all researchers in a ready-to-use format to encourage incorporation of soil fungi into macroecological analyses and boost understanding of the diversity and distribution of fungi. </p> <p>A new release including a short data paper is planned for the year 2024. The progress and early access can be followed via X, @tedersoo. </p>"},{"location":"#funding","title":"Funding","text":"<p>Funding of the fieldwork and shipping comes from the GSMc partners.
